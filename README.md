Sinmin-Corpus
=============

A	corpus is	a	collection of	authentic	texts	stored	electronically	that	can	be	used	to	discover	information about	language	that may	not	have	been	noticed	through	intuition	alone.	Corpus	linguistics	tries	to	study	the	 language	 through corpora	 to	 answer	 two	 fundamental questions: what particular	patterns are	associated with lexical or grammatical	 features and how do these patterns	differ	within	varieties	ofcontext.

In this	project we are trying	to design	and	implement a	corpus for Sinhala language which is continuously	updating,	dynamic,	covers wide	range	of language.
